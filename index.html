<h1>Group 6 Proposal Report</h1>
<h2>1) Introduction</h2>
<p>
  &emsp; a) Literature Review <br>
  &emsp; &emsp;   i)&emsp;Lu was concerned with flight prices as a time-series and <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;when to buy/wait. Lu found the AdaBoost-DecisionTree <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;algorithm had the best performance (61.35% than random <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;purchase strategy) over the eight routes examined; K-means <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;and EM to address outliers. <br>
  &emsp; &emsp;ii) &emsp;S. Gupta and N. Gupta used <q>a combination of decision tree <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;algorithms, k Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and linear <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;regression</q> on historical trends to forecast flight prices. <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;Their Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;had r2 scores of .81 and .67 respectively. <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;iii) &emsp;Tziridis et al. evaluated different regression models <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;including random forests and support vector machines on a <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;dataset of over 1,000 flights, focusing on how departure time <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;and the number of stops a given flight had would impact the <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;prediction accuracy. They found that the bagging regression <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;tree model had the highest accuracy of 87.42%. <br>
  &emsp; b) Dataset Description <br>
  &emsp; &emsp;   i)&emsp;The data will contain prices of flights over time, consisting <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;of fixed destinations and dates. The data contains information <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;for United Airfare flight SFO-LAX <br>

</p>
<h2>2) Problem Description and Motivation</h2>
<p>
  Knowing when to buy flight tickets is tricky as they fluctuate seemingly <br>unpredictably.
  Our objective is to produce a model that can predict how <br>far in advance one should purchase a flight ticket.
</p>
<h2>3) Methods</h2>
<p>
  &emsp; a) Preprocessing methods <br>
  &emsp; &emsp;   i)&emsp; Visualization<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; For each flight, a data point was created containing a column of ticket prices<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; and a column containing the number of days. This matrix was used to create a<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; scatterplot of prices over different number of days befor the plane's departure<br>
  &emsp; &emsp;ii) &emsp; Removing Outliers<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; After visualizing the data, some of the scatterplots showed signs of outliers.<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; We created a replica of the data with outliers removed. This creates gaps in the data,<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; but keeps the average flight price from becoming skewed, especially by high prices.<br>
   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; This is important for accurately finding less than average prices<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;iii) &emsp; Normalization<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; The range of flight prices vary depending on the flight. To compare the patterns<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; of flight prices between different flights, the flight prices were normalized.<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; Because of normalization, expensive flight prices are known to be close to 1,<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; and inexpensive flight prices are known to be close to 0 regardless of flight.<br>
  <h2>Flight Price with Respect to Days Before Departure</h2><br>

  &emsp; b) Supervised Learning methods <br>
  &emsp;  &emsp;  i) &emsp;Random Tree Regression<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; Random Tree Regression was chosen as the first machine learning model<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; because it showed the best results according to previous research into <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; flight price prediction. It was also reccommended as being a good introductory<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp; supervised learning method. <br>
</p>
<h2>4) Results and Discussion</h2>
<p>
  &emsp; a) Quantitative Metrics <br>
  &emsp; &emsp;  1.&emsp;Price of plane tickets <br>
  &emsp; &emsp;  2.&emsp;Days before departure<br>
  &emsp; &emsp;  3.&emsp;Additional costs such as checked baggage <br>
  &emsp; b) Project Goals <br>
  &emsp; &emsp;   i)&emsp;Identify how many days before departure one should book <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;flights from Atlanta based on destination, date of travel, and <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;personal customer preferences like (baggage, airline, etc.) in <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;order to minimize the price of the plane ticket. <br>
  &emsp; &emsp;ii) &emsp;Determine during what seasons are prices of plane tickets <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;the cheapest.<br>
  &emsp; c) Expected Results <br>
  &emsp;&emsp; We expect that prices of plane tickets are most expensive a month<br>
  &emsp;&emsp; before the date of departure. Prices should be cheapest several <br>
  &emsp;&emsp; months before the date of departure, but not immediately after the<br>
  &emsp;&emsp; flight&apos;s posting. <br>
